Welcome to Flatiron Wordle!

This is our phase 2 project for the Flatiron coding bootcamp. Our inspiration came from the 
New York Times world famous Wordle game. We sought to push our coding abilities by recreating this
game, and to learn how to make full use of the React library.

We had just as much fun creating this game as we do playing it, and hope you enjoy it.
